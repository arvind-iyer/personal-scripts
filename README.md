# Muh Scripts

### 1. PrintQueueTool.sh
   A script modified from the [original one](http://itsc.ust.hk/kb/article-504.html) provided by the ITSC department at HKUST to install and manage University Satellite and Barn printers. The original only works for init based systems such as Ubuntu. This works for OSes configured with systemd such as Fedora, Arch or CentOS.
